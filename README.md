# OpenCV Image Blending and Arithmetic

This repository contains my third set of computer vision exercises under **Zgt Studio**.  
The focus is on **weighted addition**, **image blending/overlay**, and **grayscale + arithmetic operations** using OpenCV.

---

## 1. Exercises

### 1.1 Weighted Image Addition

Folder: `OpenCV Weighted Image Addition/`

This example demonstrates weighted addition of two images using `cv2.addWeighted`.

**Script:**
- `Weighted_Addition.py`

---

### 1.2 Image Blending / Overlay

Folder: `OpenCV Image Blending Overlay/`

This example blends two images to create a smooth overlay effect.

**Script:**
- `image_blending_overlay.py`

---

### 1.3 Grayscale and Arithmetic Operations

Folder: `OpenCV Grayscale and Arithmetic Operations/`

This example converts an image to grayscale and demonstrates basic arithmetic operations.

**Script:**
- `grayscale_and_arithmetic.py`

---

## 2. Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

Install:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
